# Neural Network models

This repositerory contains one folder for each model I developed ,as of today, in my 2024 fall course in advanced machine learning. 

So far I constructed a simple cnn decoder (cnn_numbers) for image denoising, a model made from an efficient net convolutional backbone for image classification (image_net) and a rnn for time series analysis (RNN).

Each folder includes the jupyter notebook, the model structure and the predicted outputs file. The data was pulled from a private AWS s3 bucket for our class.

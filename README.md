# Neural Network models

This repositerory contains one folder for each model I developed ,as of today, in my 2024 fall course in advanced machine learning. 

So far I constructed a simple cnn decoder (cnn_numbers) for image denoising, a model made from an efficient net convolutional backbone for image classification (image_net), a rnn for time series analysis (RNN), and a model to identify which one of two images is the generated (gan generated), using an efficient net backbone and clip tokenizer embeddings of the caption used to generate the fake picture.

Each folder includes the jupyter notebook, the model structure and the predicted outputs file. The data was pulled from a private AWS s3 bucket for our class.
